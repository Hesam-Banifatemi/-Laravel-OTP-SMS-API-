# -Laravel-OTP-SMS-API-
This API will get the user's vote and phone number and sends a POST request to the sms.ir api and then a sms containing OTP token will be sent by the sms.ir and then user Authentication will be done. so finally after verifying use's vote and other data will be saved in the database.
